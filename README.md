# TensorFlow
Introduction to TensorFlow <b/>
<b/>
TensorFlow is an open-source platform for machine learning developed by the Google Brain team. It is widely used for building and deploying machine learning models, including deep learning models. TensorFlow provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that enable developers to create and deploy machine learning applications efficiently. 

**Features**<b/>
Flexible Ecosystem: TensorFlow offers multiple levels of abstraction, making it suitable for both beginners and experts. It supports high-level APIs such as Keras for quick model prototyping and low-level APIs for more detailed model customization.<b/>
Cross-Platform: TensorFlow can be deployed on various platforms including desktops, servers, mobile devices, and edge devices.<b/>
Scalability: TensorFlow supports distributed computing, allowing for training and deploying models across multiple GPUs and TPUs.<b/>
Integration: TensorFlow integrates well with other Google products and services, such as TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for end-to-end ML pipelines, TensorFlow Lite for mobile and IoT, and TensorFlow.js for in-browser ML.<b/>
